## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for checking out this repo [AP-Covid-Tracker-Webapp](https://github.com/beharavenkatasatyaprasad/AP-Covid-Tracker-Webapp).


## The Webapp

Click [here](https://covid19-ap-webapp.netlify.app/) to preview the app.

This app is to integrate myself with the [Covid India API](https://api.covid19india.org) (district-wise) to pull data and display it.

I have used HTML,CSS & JavaScript on the front-end to develop this particular Webapp.

Users are able to:

- See all districts wise data of AndhraPradesh from the API on the homepage
- Search for a state using an `input` field
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

Want some support on making such Webapps? feel free to [Ping me](https://wa.me/917093657303?text=Hello%20Satya) and ask questions.
